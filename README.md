# 🚀 Toggle Use Client

A simple VS Code extension to toggle `"use client"` at the top of your file. Comes with **Add** and **Remove** commands too — cuz why not 😏

---

## 📦 Commands

- **Use Client: Toggle**
- **Use Client: Add**
- **Use Client: Remove**

## ⚡ TL;DR

Hit `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS or `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux and type `use client`.

Or better yet, set your keybinds and you're good to go. 💪
